    "## A notebook to for Protein-Ligand Simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook sets up a simulation to calculate $k_{on}$ from a coarse-grained simulation. For all terms and purpose the rates from 'most' coarse-grained molecular simulations should be used for comparisions --- and we should not trust the absolute values. For example, for a particular protein we can get an idea of qualitative comparisions of the rates for a variety of ligands. \n",

    "### Possible Applications ...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Protein-Ligand Binding Studies\n",
    "Binding Affinity and Free Energy Calculations - Martini 3 can estimate binding free energies of ligands to protein targets, aiding in understanding the thermodynamics of binding; Useful for prioritizing ligands in drug discovery workflows.; Identifies potential binding sites by simulating ligand docking to protein surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Drug Discovery and Design - Efficiently screens large libraries of small molecules to identify candidates for further refinement.; Reduced computational cost allows simulation of many protein-ligand systems.; Lead Optimization: Explores the structural dynamics of protein-ligand complexes to refine ligand design for improved binding.; Allosteric Modulation: Simulates small molecules binding at allosteric sites to understand their regulatory effects on protein activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Protein-Small Molecule Interactions - Models interactions between enzymes and their substrates, products, or cofactors.; Studies the effects of metabolites on protein conformations.; Simulates the binding and release dynamics of small molecules to/from transport proteins (e.g., ion channels, transporters).; Explores the dynamics of covalent or reversible modifications of proteins by small molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Membrane-Associated Systems - Studies the binding of ligands to membrane proteins (e.g., GPCRs, ion channels) in their native lipid bilayer environment.; Assesses the effects of the lipid environment on binding affinity and protein dynamics.; Models the partitioning and diffusion of small molecules within lipid bilayers.\n",
    "Useful for designing membrane-permeable drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Allosteric Regulation and Functional Modulation - Studies how small molecules modulate protein function by binding to allosteric sites.; Explores the dynamics of allosteric pathways within proteins.; Simulates ligand-induced changes in protein conformations linked to downstream signaling events.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Aggregation and Phase Behavior - Studies the effects of small molecules on the aggregation behavior of amyloid-forming proteins (e.g., Aβ peptides); Explores therapeutic strategies for diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.; Models the influence of small molecules on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Toxicology and Pharmacology - Simulates interactions between small molecules and unintended protein targets to predict off-target effects.; Models how small molecules interact with detoxification proteins (e.g., cytochrome P450 enzymes) to predict pharmacokinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given, \n",
    "\n",
    "- We have an automated way to parametrize a variety of ligands (not so far in future)\n",
    "- We have a 'WORKING' python wrapper for GROMACS (maybe there are workarounds)\n",
    "- An automated way to characterize important features of the binding pockets - the important water molecules. This should in principle be available from the PDB structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could maybe come up with a toolkit to **quickly** calculate $k_{on}$ for a bunch of ligands. And pass these to more expensive calculations at a later point."

    "### Basics of Small-Molecule Parametrization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider only non-hydrogen atoms to define the mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid dividing chemical functional groups (e.g., amide, carboxylate, etc.) between two beads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retain in the CG representation as much as possible (1) the symmetry and (2) the molecular volume and shape of the underlying AA structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep in mind that the default bead sizes for mapping linear molecular fragments are one regular (R) bead for 4 non-hydrogen atoms (4-1), one small (S) bead for three (3-1), and one tiny (T) bead for two (2-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider that R-beads are the most computationally-performant option; S-beads are useful to mimic the “bulkier” shape of aliphatic rings, while T-beads are particularly suited to represent atom-thick, conjugated rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimize the number of beads such that there is at most a mismatch of ±1 non-hydrogen atom every 10 non-hydrogen atoms. Some exceptions may be allowed if well-tested (e.g., mapping of thiophene or furan with three T-beads have a mismatch of −1 given that 5 non-hydrogen atoms are mapped onto 3 T-beads which are parameterized to represent 6 non-hydrogen atoms).\n",
    "\n",
    "- For fully branched fragments, use beads of one size smaller than the size determined based on the non-hydrogen atom count. The rationale behind this is that the central atom of a branched group is not exposed to the environment (i.e., it is buried), which reduces its influence on the interactions. For example, a neopentane group contains 5 non-hydrogen atoms but it can be effectively modeled with an R-bead\n",
